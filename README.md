#SLAVE_1

SLAVE_1 is a bot which, if you are the master, compliments your messages. If someone else types a message, it insults their message, or at least reminds them to seek the master's guidance. In addition, it changes its name beforehand, to imitate the existence of a group of fans.

##Installation

To install, perform ```npm install``` in the same directory as SLAVE_1. Then, create a file that resembles the following named secrets.json in the same directory.
```
{
  "token": "YOURTOKENHERE",
  "master": "YOURUSERNAMEHERE"
}```
Change YOURTOKENHERE to a token from the (Discord developer site)[https://discordapp.com/developers] and YOURUSERNAMEHERE to the username you want to be provided with support.
