# Ajax

Ajax is a bot that does many things. 
1) He keeps track of participation of members of a server by giving them XP.
2) He creates subscription roles so you can have announcements go out to only the groups subscribed to them.

## Installation

This is my bot. Don't steal my bot.

## Execution

To execute, perform ```nodemon``` in the same directory as Ajax.
